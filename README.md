# Survon Council Seat

A configurable council member seat that provides domain-specific expertise to the Survon smart homestead system. Each seat runs as an independent instance with a specific strategy (domain expertise).

## Strategies

|----------|-------------|
| `librarian` | Reads and searches static knowledge from documents/manifests |
| `medicine` | Medical expertise (requires specialized LLM) |
| `mechanical` | Mechanical engineering expertise |
| `botany` | Agriculture and plant expertise |
| `veterinary` | Animal health expertise |
| `building` | Construction and architecture expertise |
| `survival` | Survival skills and preparedness |

### The Librarian Strategy

The librarian is the default strategy that reads from static knowledge. It uses SQLite FTS5 for fast full-text search.

**Loading Knowledge:**

Knowledge is stored in the database and can be searched. The librarian automatically loads sample data on first run.

**Query Format:**

Simply ask questions and the librarian will search its knowledge base and return relevant excerpts with source citations.

## Running Multiple Seats

To run multiple council members (e.g., on different Raspberry Pis):

**Pi 1:**
```bash
export COUNCIL_STRATEGY=librarian
./survon-runtime-council-seat
```

**Pi 2:**
```bash
export COUNCIL_STRATEGY=medicine
./survon-runtime-council-seat
```

**Pi 3:**
```bash
export COUNCIL_STRATEGY=botany
./survon-runtime-council-seat
```

## Survon OS Integration
